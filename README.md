# RoleChooser
A simple tool to help choose what roles you want to play in League of Legends

How to use: Simply click on the role you last played, and the tool will automatically calculate your least played role or least recently played role based off your previous inputs. I will definitely add more functionality later, so stay tuned. Current ideas are also adding what champion to play for each role depending on your pool and using the same algorithm, or customizing which roles to pick from.

Recommendation: Load up your op.gg and look at the past 20-40 games and add them one by one. I'll probably end up using Riot API to do this automatically to populate the list, but that's on the to-do list.

How to run: Run main.py with Python 3 ("python3 ./main.py")
