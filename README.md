# RoleChooser
A simple tool to help choose what roles you want to play in League of Legends

How to use: Simply click on the role you last played, and the tool will automatically calculate your least 
played role based off your previous inputs. I will definitely add more functionality later, so stay tuned.

How to run: Run main.py with Python 3 ("python3 ./main.py")
